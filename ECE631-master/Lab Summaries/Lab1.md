In today's lab we setup and established connections to Mosquitto MQTT Broker,
Javascript HiveMQ, and Freeboard dashboard. In addition to learning some of the
commands for installing these softwares and plugins, I learned a bit more about
how our RPi's connections can be utilized. As seen in HiveMQ our IP connections
can be utilized for multiconnection messaging communication. As Prof. Herrmann
stated in lab, Freeboard can be used as another means of display and read MQTT
information and messages.

Note: Your hostname or IP can be used to connect to your RPi.
    My hostname: Payne.Erin (ssh pi@Payne.Erin or ssh pi@192.168.1.222)
