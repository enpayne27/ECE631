Lab 0 - 01B

Spring 2019

In today's lab we setup and established all necessary connections for our 
Raspberry Pi 3. In addition to learning how to initalize some of the starting 
components of the RPi, I was able to get a brief insight into some of the 
structure, accessories and consoles the RPi has to offer. Although most of the
setup was a one time ordeal (hopefully, if done correctly), I was able to 
practice some of the basic commands for operating the RPi once I set up the ssh
interface. The following were some of the commands I learned:

    - sudo raspi-config (opens configuration settings)
    - sudo ping ______.com (sends ping signal to test latency/connections)
    - <ctrl> C (cancel or stop processes)
    - sudo ifconfig (produces device data like IP and MAC addresses)
    - sudo apt update/upgrade (updates and upgrades softwares of device)
    - sudo poweroff (stops processes and powers off device)
    
Though most of these commands are very rudimentary, I belive knowing these
commands for the future will be very important to performing fundamental
processes on the RPi. As Prof. Hermann stated, after this and the next lab or
two, we will be using the ssh terminal much more frequently than the included
RPi console, so it will be important to memorize basic commands to perform
future labs and tasks efficiently.

Overall, I believe this lab was a quick and easy intro to RPi usage and setup, 
and will be very important knowledge to have for future labs if I am to improve
and expand my Linux and RPi skills.
